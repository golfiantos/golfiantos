    "The goal of the project is to evaluate the <b>credit payment behaviour and performance</b> of some bank clients based on their age, family status, etc. The data is already available and ready to be imported and analyzed\n",
    "    \n",
    "To begin with, let us try to understand the context first, how is the bussiness flow works with its potential problem, stakeholders, etc. It is common, that banks has services to lend some money or credit for its costumer. Before lending amount of money, customers are asked for their personal information such as age, family status, job status, purpose of registration, etc. By collecting the real data of costumer performance, the Bank can further analyze and predict which new costumer submission should be accepted or declined. Furthermore we would like to know what are factors can really affect the performance of credit payment. Some hypothesis or question can be made here, for examples:\n",
    "    <li>What is relationship between taking debt and family status? Current hypothesis: The higher the total income, the less probability of people will pay the credit on-time\n",
    "    <li>What is the most reason of people taking debt?\n",
    "    <li>etc\n",
    "    \n",
    "After knowing the bussiness, let us continue with data Data Understanding. All of the steps are described as follows:\n",
    "    <li>Import the data, see data sample, understand the column definition, obtain general information, shape, data type, etc\n",
    "    <li>Explore the data:\n",
    "    -Which data has missing values?\n",
    "    -Which data has duplicate values?\n",
    "    -Which data has odd value?\n",
    "        \n",
    "And the continuing with data transform and cleansing, feature engineering (making new column as needed), analysis and conclude our hypothesis\n",
