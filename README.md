- 👷🏻‍♂️ I’m a mechanical engineer and also data science enthusiast
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on any data science project
- 📫 How to reach me: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hari-golfianto/
- 📂 Here are some projects that I have done and been involved in.

# Data science projects 
| No. | Project name              | Description                 | Tools/libraries                    |
| :- | :-------------------- | :--------------------- | :---------------------------|
| 01 | [to be added](https://github.com/golfiantos/projects/tree/main/to_be_added "to be added") | to be added... | *pandas, matplotlib.pyplot* |
| 02 | [Credit card scoring](https://github.com/golfiantos/projects/tree/main/02_credit_card_scoring "Credit card scoring") | Preparing reports for the credit division of a bank. Determining the effect of a customer's marital status and the number of children sought on the probability of default in loan repayment. | *pandas, matplotlib.pyplot* |
| 03 | [Predicting telco client churn](https://github.com/golfiantos/projects/tree/main/03_predicting_client_churn "Predicting client churn") | A telecommunications operator offers landline communication and internet services to its clients. They are interested in forecasting churn among their clients. The goal is to identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them by analyzing their personal data, contract details, and service usage patterns. | *seaborn, plotly, sklearn (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest), smote, xgboost* |

# 30-week code challenge 
## (Railway engineering/Rolling stock related)
- I plan to commit to a 30-week code challenge. The objectives are consistent learning and improvement over an extended period, expanding networking, technology exploration, and problem-solving training.
- Instead of the common 30-day code challenge, I plan to undertake a 30-week code challenge due to my limitations.
- Rules:
  - Code or work for a minimum of 4 hours per week.
  - Project outcomes will be adjusted to fit my constraints, mainly time-related.
  - Project topics must be related to railway/rolling stock areas and may include machine learning, automation, and even CAE/CAD analysis tasks.
- Please reach out to me when you have a great idea (again, selected ideas will be adjusted to fit my limitations).
- A tangible schedule is currently being prepared.
- I hope this initiative will have a positive impact not only on myself but also on the railway industry.
- Additionally, I am open to collaboration opportunities.
